In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.
Marked cardiomegaly is unchanged, but pulmonary vascular congestion has improved, and previously described edema has nearly completely resolved.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
Left hilar prominence may be a normal findings in a patient of this age.
Repeat after treatment to document resolution.
The aorta is unfolded.
Increasing confluent right basilar opacity may reflect asymmetrical edema or secondary process such as aspiration or infection.
Compared to the prior radiograph, the right IJ line and NG tube have been removed.
Heart size is top- normal.
Given the acute fluctuations, findings favor mild interstitial edema rather than an infectious process.
No acute cardiopulmonary process.
The apperance of the distal left clavicle is stable.
Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.
Pleural effusions are presumed, but not substantial.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
2. Mild pulmonary edema.
As compared to ___, there is low lung volumes with marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Aside from mild crowding of vessels at the bases, lungs are clear.
No pulmonary nodules are identified within the limits of conventional radiography.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
No free air below the right hemidiaphragm.
2. Enlarged pulmonary arteries are suspicious for pulmonary hypertension.
The heart size is normal.
The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged with left ventricular configuration.
