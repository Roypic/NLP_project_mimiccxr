The lungs are otherwise clear with no evidence of focal opacities concerning for infectious process.
Right PICC line again extends to the cavoatrial junction.
Streaky opacity at the left lung base thought likely atelectatic in etiology.
No effusion or pneumothorax.
There is mild obscuration of the right cardiac border, however, no definite densities are appreciated on the lateral view.
Patchy nodular opacities projecting over the lateral left lower lung may be due to pneumonia.
This abnormality is accompanied by greater atelectasis in the right upper lobe where a large mass was seen previously, and obscures the contours of the heart, right hilus and mediastinum.
